Core concepts of data mining
1) What is Data Mining?
	a) Articulate what data mining is within the context of its evolution, as an interdisciplinary subfield,  as an essential step of knowledge and pattern discovery, and as a type of business analytics; 
	 	** It means what is the impact of using this technique that really solve problem in reality.
	b) Point out practical applications of data mining as a tool for solving real-life problems;
		** Use data mining as a tool for computational problem that turned into a product (application).
	c) Synthesize the benefits of data mining in extracting knowledge from data; and
		** What is the outcome of the knowledged learned from the data? Using the data mining.
	e) Relate the challenges of data mining to a specific discipline
		** What challenege you will face while using the data mining as a tool from a certain problem?.
2) Data Mining Process Models
	a) Create a data mining pipeline by interrelating the different stages of the data mining process models.
		** Meaning, we want to solve a problem with a proper technique and processes on different phase.

3) Crafting Data Mining Problem Statement
	a) Craft a data mining problem statement based on a pipeline
		** Create a step by step flow to solve an actual problem
	b) Make distinctions(similarties) of descriptive and inferential analysis
		** We know, we can get possible solutions, but how those solutions different from each other?
	d) Synthesize the steps in solving a data mining problem
		** Detailed steps of the solution in the problem.
    e) Make distinctions of the five primary questions that data mining asks in solving problems
        ** Actually, the five primary questions would help you to understand the problem with concrete solutions.
    f) Identify the type of a data mining question;
        ** What questions should we used for initial phase in data mining.
    g) Craft a data mining question.
        ** Create detailed choices and answers on the questions provided.
4) Data preprocessing
	a) Describe the various preprocessing methods;
		** What are the available steps for creating solution in preprocessing phase.
	b) Apply a data preprocessing method that is appropriate for a given data.
		** Create a method that allows to process each step on the model.
		** Its time to tell the created pre processing methods
