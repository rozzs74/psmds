At the end of the session, you should be able:
	- Craft a data mining problem statement based on a pipeline that you have created in the previous session;
	- Make distinctions of descriptive and inferential analysis; and
	- Synthesize the steps in solving a data mining problem.

Steps in Solving a Data Mining Problem
	- Data mining begins with the question:  "How can we solve a problem using data?" 
		1) Practical motivation and sample collection
			-  answer the ff questions
				a) Is the problem related to data?
				b) If yes, can you solve this problem using data in practice?
			Please write it down and use it as a guide in answering the next step of solving a problem using data.
			- After crafting a problem that can be solved using data, you need to think about how to collect the relevant data. 
				It's always good to review a lesson in statistics about getting a sample of a population.
				In collecting data, you must answer the following questions.
				a) Does the data you are trying to collect match the problem?
				b) Does the data represent reality?

		2) Problem formulation and data preparation
			- Which of the following questions describes a data mining problem?
				a) Can age, blood type, location, and travel history predict if someone would most likely be infected with COVID 19?
				b) How do I know whether someone has infected with COVID 19?
			- With the data mining problem that you have formulated in the previous step, you can now prepare your data for analysis. 
			Which of the following is the best kind of data? 
				a) Data from different sources
				b) Data in a grid format
				c) Noisy data
		3) Statistical description and exploratory analysis
			- How can we clearly express the data with some representations? What statistical insights are relevant? 
				What kind of algorithm do you need to apply to find connections between data points? How to effectively aggregate the data?
			- In this stage, exploratory analysis is essential to have initial insights that we can get from the data.  
				During exploratory analysis, some statistical properties of the dataset(mean, median, variance, distribution) are studied. 
		4) Pattern recognition and analytical visualization
			-Exploratory analysis is commonly referred to as descriptive analytics.  In this type of analytics, statistical characteristics of data are presented in the form of visualization.  
				This is the presentation of information using spatial or graphical representations for
				a) comparison facilitation
				b) pattern recognition and 
				c) initial decision making
			- Types of Visualization
				a) Explore or Calculate = this type of visualization requires a further analysis which requires a reason about a conveyed information.
				b) Commnunicate = this type explains the information and suggests a hint for decision making.
            - Visualization can also be classified according to purposes, such as comparison, composition, distribution, and relationship.  Figure 1.3 3 presents the different graphical presentations according to these classifications.  The following questions can serve as a guide in determining which among the types is best suited for specific data.
                How many variables do you want to show in a single chart?
                How many data points will you display for each variable?
                Will you display values over a while, or among items or groups?
		5) Machine learning and algorithmic optimization
			- In the previous steps, data was used for statistics and data visualization.  
				This step emphasizes machine learning and algorithmic optimization.
				The tasks in steps 1 to 5 can be broadly categorized as descriptive and inferential analytics.
			- The goal of descriptive analytics is to describe the population or dataset under study.  
				The description can be used to generalized to any other group or population.
			- The inferential analytics is produced through complex mathematical calculations. The findings can be taken from the sample group and be generalized to a larger population.
		6) Statistical inference an information presentation.
			- It is also important to understand that learning algorithms are not perfect.  So, how to confidently infer from statistical results?
			- Statistical inference can become certain in two ways:
				a) Generalize the learning procedure or model
				b) Estimate the confidence of prediction by the genera model
		7) Intelligence decision and ethical consideration
			- Data science is a team sport. Most of the time, it is essential to make decisions on real-life problems with the assistance of a domain expert. 
			- It is also essential to keep in mind to safeguard data that needs utmost confidentiality.  
				Hence, in analyzing data, it is necessary to consider the legality and privacy of individuals or organizations.
