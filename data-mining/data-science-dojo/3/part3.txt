Attribute Classification
Important of attribute classes
	- Categorical Attributes (Descrite attributes) 
		- means finite state of values typically, any data attribute which is categorical in nature represents discrete values which belong to a specific finite set of categories or classes. 
		- An attribute where the values correspond to discrete categories. For example, state is a categorical attribute with discrete values (CA, NY, MA, etc.). 
        - Categorical attributes are either non-ordered (nominal) like state, gender, etc., or ordered (ordinal) such as high, medium, or low temperatures.
		- Feature engineering on categorical data
		- Bar plot and pie chart is used to visualize categorical data.
		- Types of categorical attributes:
			1) Nominal - A nominal scale describes a variable with categories that do not have a natural order or ranking. 
                    with numbers if you want, but the order is arbitrary and any calculations, such as computing a mean, median, or standard deviation, would be meaningless.
				- nominal is qualitative data
                - providing name
                - A nominal scale describes a variable with categories that do not have a natural order or ranking
                - Examples
					ID numbers, eye color, zip codes, movie, music, video games genres, country names, weather, geno type, blood type
			2) Ordinal - ordered,An ordinal scale is one where the order matters but not the difference between values 
                - An ordinal scale is one where the order matters but not the difference between values.
                - ordinal is qualitative data
				- Examples
					Rankings, place in competition, grades, clothing sizes(XL, L, M, S XS), shoe sizes, education level, employment roles, socio economic status (“low income”,”middle income”,”high income”), satisfaction rating (“extremely dislike”, “dislike”, “neutral”, “like”, “extremely like”).
			3) Interval - is a constant value with different values 
                - An interval scale is one where there is order and the difference between two values is meaningful.
                - interval is quantitative data
                - not zero 
				- Examples
					temperatures in Celius or Fahrenheit
			4) Ratio - A ratio variable, has all the properties of an interval variable, and also has a clear definition of 0.0. When the variable equals 0.0, there is none of that variable.
				     - When working with ratio variables , the ratio of two measurements has a meaningful interpretation
                     - ratio is quantitative data
                     - can be zero
				- Examples
					Temperature in kelvin, length, time, counts, enzyme activity, dose amount, reaction rate, flow rate, concentration, pulse, weight, length, temperature in Kelvin (0.0 Kelvin really does mean “no heat”), survival time.
					 For example, because weight is a ratio variable, a weight of 4 grams is twice as heavy as a weight of 2 grams. 
		- In the 1940s, Stanley Smith Stevens introduced four scales of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. 
        - These are still widely used today as a way to describe the characteristics of a variable. 
        - Knowing the scale of measurement for a variable is an important aspect in choosing the right statistical analysis.

        - Does measurement scale matter for data analysis? 
            - Knowing the measurement scale for your variables can help prevent mistakes like taking the average of a group of zip (postal) codes, 
             or taking the ratio of two pH values. 
             Beyond that, knowing the measurement scale for your variables doesn’t really help you plan your analyses or interpret the results.
        - Test understanding
            Favorite candy bar = Nominal, not order
            Weight of luggage  = Ratio, luggage weight can be 0.
            Year of your birth = Interval, its constant
            Egg size (small, medium, large, extra large, jumbo) = Ordinal, its ordered
            Military rank = Ordinal, its ordered
            Number of children in a family = Ratio, can be zero meaning no children.
            Jersey numbers for a football team = Nominal, no order
            Shoe size = Interval, constant
        -  Quantitative (Numerical) vs Qualitative (Categorical)
            - There are other ways of classifying variables that are common in statistics. One is qualitative vs. quantitative
            - Qualitative variables are descriptive/categorical. Many statistics, such as mean and standard deviation, do not make sense to compute with qualitative variables.
            - Quantitative variables have numeric meaning, so statistics like means and standard deviations make sense. 
            - This type of classification can be important to know in order to choose the correct type of statistical analysis.
