Data Quality
	- data quality is the precondition for analyzing and using big data
	- big data has 4vs: Volume(size), Velocity(speed), Variety(types), Value(scale) (Katal, Wazid, & Goudar, 2013)
	- data that is "'fit for use' in their intended operational, decision-making and other roles" or that exhibits "'conformance to standards' that have been set, so that fitness for use is achieved"
	- refers to the state of qualitative or quantitative pieces of information. 
	- very important when it comes to decision is having a data quality. By asking where the 
		problem is coming from.
	- most commonly looked by data scientist 
	- Three fundamental questions in data quality
		1) What problems should we worry about?
		2) How can we detect problems with the data?
		3) What can we do about these problems?
	- Examples of data quality problems (that shows up in production all the time):
		- Noise and outliers
		- Missing values 
		- Duplicate data
	- By rapidly acquiring and analyzing big data from various sources and with various uses, 
		researchers and decision-makers have gradually realized that this massive amount of information has benefits for under- standing customer needs, 
		improving service quality, and predicting and preventing risks. 
		However, the use and analysis of big data must be based on accurate and high-quality data,
		which is a necessary condition for generating value from big data. 
		Therefore, we analyzed the challenges faced by big data and proposed a quality assessment framework and assessment process for it.
	- Challenges in data quality under big or small data scope
		1)  The diversity of data sources brings abundant data types and complex data structures and increases the difficulty of data integration.
			- The more data sources, unstructured data, complexity it makes difficult to generate data quality.
			- There are conflicts and inconsistent or contradictory phenomena among data from different sources.
			- unstructured data for example, documents, video, audio, etc.
			- semi-structured data, including: software packages/modules, spreadsheets, and financial reports
			- structured data. The quantity of unstructured data occupies more than 80% of the total amount of data in existence.
		2) Data volume is tremendous, and it is difficult to judge data quality within a reasonable amount of time.
			- It is difficult to collect, clean, integrate, and finally obtain the necessary high-quality data within a reasonable time frame.
			- Because the proportion of unstructured data in big data is very high, it will take a lot of time to transform unstructured types into structured types and further pro- cess the data.  
			- This is a great challenge to the existing techniques of data processing quality.
		3) Data change very fast and the “timeliness” of data is very short, which necessitates higher requirements for processing technology.
			- Due to the rapid changes in big data, the “timeliness” of some data is very short
			- Efficiency and speed is really important to obtain data quality because If companies can’t collect the required data in real time or deal with the data needs over a very long time, then they may obtain outdated and invalid information.
			- Processing and analysis based on these data will produce useless or misleading conclusions, eventually leading to decision-making mistakes
		4) No unified and approved data quality standards have been formed
			- In order to guarantee the product quality and improve benefits to enterprises, need to have standards.
	- Data quality depends not only on its own features but also on the business environment using the data, 
		including business processes and business users.
	- Only the data that conform to the relevant uses and meet requirements can be consid- ered qualified (or good quality) data. 
	- Usually, data quality standards are developed from the perspective of data producers.
	- Data quality framework
		1) Data Quality Dimensions
			- Availability
			- Usability
			- Reliability
			- Relevance
			- Presentation Quality
		2) Data Quality Elements
			- Under Availability
				- Accessibility
				- Timeliness
				- Authorization
			- Under Usability
				- Definition of documentation
				- Credibility
				- MetaData
			- Under Reliability
				- Accuracy
				- Integrity
				- Consistency
				- Completeness
				- Auditability
			- Under Relevance
				- Fitness
			- Under Presentation Quality
				- Readability
				- Structure
		3) Indicators
Noise
	- An invalid signal overlapping valid data
	- Data has inaccurate values
	- Examples
		1) Distortion of a person's voice over the phone.
		2) Snow on a television screen
		3) Human inconsistency in labeling, example is in sport judging the performance
	- invalid data pointes that obscuring the signals
	- determing the attributes which are noisy

Outliers
	- Data objects with characteristics that are considerably different than most 
		of the other data objects in data sets.
	- is data point that differs significantly from other observations.
	- the data is valid values and properly collected and clean but "ITS outside of the normal range"

Missing Values 
	- Reasons for missing values 
		1) Information is not collected 
			- (e.g., people decline to give their age and weight)
		2) Attributes may not applicable to all cases
			- (e.g., annual income is not applicable to children)
	- Handling missing values 
		1) Eliminate Data Objects
		2) Estimate Missing Values
		3) Ignore the missing values during analysis
		4) Replcate with all possible values (weighted by their probabilities)
Duplicate Data 
	- Data set may include data objects that are duplicates, or almost duplicates
		of one another 
	- Major issue when merging data from heterogeneous sources
	- Example
		Same person with multiple email addresses
