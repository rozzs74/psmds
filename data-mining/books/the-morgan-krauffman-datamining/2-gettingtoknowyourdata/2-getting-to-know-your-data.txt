Getting to know your data, it's tempting to jump straight
    The first major task of the data mining process, gaining such insight into the data will help with the subsequent analysis.
        - You will want to know the following
            1) What are the types of attributes or fields that make up your data?
            2) What kind of values does each attribute have?
            3) Which attributes are discrete, and which are continuous-valued?
            4) What do the data look like?
            5) How are the values distributed?
            6) Are there ways we can visualize the data to get a better sense of it all?
            7) Can we spot any outliers?
            8) Can we measure the similarity of some data objects with respect to others? 
    Basic statistical description and the following is the measures of central tendency which give us an idea of the “middle” or center of distribution.
        - Given a temperature attribute, for example, we can determine its mean (average value)
        - median (middle value),
        - median (middle value),
        - Knowing such basic statistics regarding each attribute makes it easier to fill in missing values, smooth noisy values, and spot outliers during data preprocessing.
        - Quantile plots, histograms, and scatter plots are other graphic dis- plays of basic statistical descriptions, These can all be useful during data preprocessing and can provide insight into areas for mining.
    Knowledge of the attributes and attribute values can also help in fixing inconsistencies incurred dur- ing data integration
    The similarity/dissimilarity (clustering) between objects may also be used to detect out-liers in the data, or to perform nearest-neighbor classification.
        - There are many measures for assessing similarity and dissimilarity. In general, such mea- sures are referred to as proximity measures.


Data objects and Attribute types
	- Data sets are made up of data objects
		- data objects
			- represents an entity—in a sales database
			- typically described by attributes.
