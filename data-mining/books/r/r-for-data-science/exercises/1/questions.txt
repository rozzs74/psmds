1. Run ggplot(data = mpg). What do you see?
    - ggplot(data=mpg)
    -  see this image 1.1-exercise-answer.png
	- This code creates an empty plot. The ggplot() function creates the background of the plot, but since no layers were specified with geom function, nothing is drawn.
2. How many rows are in mtcars? How many columns?
	- There are 234 rows and 11 columns in the mpg data frame.
	- nrow(mtcars)
		[1] 32
	- ncol(mtcars)
		[1] 11

	- glimpse(mpg)
3. What does the drv variable describe? Read the help for ?mpg to find out.
	- The drv variable is a categorical variable which categorizes cars into front-wheels, rear-wheels, or four-wheel drive.
	- the type of drive train, where f = front-wheel drive, r = rear wheel drive, 4 = 4wd
	- ?mpg
4. Make a scatterplot of hwy versus cyl.
	- ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cyl, y =hwy))

5. What happens if you make a scatterplot of class versus drv? Why is the plot not useful?
	- ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x=class, y=drv))
	- see image 1.5.1-exercise-answer.png
	- A scatter plot is not a useful display of these variables since both drv and class are categorical variables. Since categorical variables typically take a small number of values, there are a limited number of unique combinations of (x, y) values that can be displayed. In this data, drv takes 3 values and class takes 7 values, meaning that there are only 21 values that could be plotted on a scatterplot of drv vs. class. In this data, there 12 values of (drv, class) are observed. 
	- A simple scatter plot does not show how many observations there are for each (x, y) value. As such, scatterplots work best for plotting a continuous x and a continuous y variable, and when all (x, y) values are unique
