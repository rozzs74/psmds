The syntax in R looks confusing, but only to begin with. It is a LISP-style language inspired by an even older language (S). The assignment syntax is probably the strangest thing you will see. Assignment uses the arrow (<-) rather than a single equals (=). Also, like many programming languages, R syntax is case sensitive.
