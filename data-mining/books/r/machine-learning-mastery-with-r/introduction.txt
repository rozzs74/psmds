Letâ€™s start with an overview of the common tasks in a machine learning project. 
    A predictive modeling machine learning project can be broken down into 6 top-level tasks:
    1. Define Problem: Investigate and characterize the problem in order to better understand the goals of the project.
    2. Analyze Data: Use descriptive statistics and visualization to better understand the data you have available.
    3. Prepare Data: Use data transforms in order to better expose the structure of the prediction problem to modeling algorithms.
    4. Evaluate Algorithms: Design a test harness to evaluate a number of standard algorithms on the data and select the top few to investigate further.
    5. Improve Results: Use algorithm tuning and ensemble methods to get the most out of well-performing algorithms on your data.
    6. Present Results: Finalize the model, make predictions and present results.
